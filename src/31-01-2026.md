# Abstract Class Example in Java – Bank Accounts

This example explains how **abstract classes** are used in Java with a real-world scenario: **bank accounts**.
Different types of bank accounts follow the same basic structure but calculate interest in different ways.
To handle this, we use an abstract base class and extend it for specific account types.

---

## Problem Statement

We want to design a system that represents different types of bank accounts:

* A **generic Account** that stores common information
* A **Fixed Deposit Account** where interest depends on principal, rate, and duration
* A **Recurring Deposit Account** where interest depends on monthly deposits

Since **interest calculation logic differs** for each account type, it is declared as an **abstract method** in the base class.

---

## Source Code

```java
abstract class Account {
    String AccountHolder;
    int PrincipalAmt;

    Account(String AccountHolder, int PrincipalAmt) {
        this.AccountHolder = AccountHolder;
        this.PrincipalAmt = PrincipalAmt;
    }

    abstract double calculateInterest();
}
```

```java
class FixDeposit extends Account {
    int RateOfInterest;
    int Duration;

    FixDeposit(String AccountHolder, int PrincipalAmt, int RateOfInterest, int Duration) {
        super(AccountHolder, PrincipalAmt);
        this.RateOfInterest = RateOfInterest;
        this.Duration = Duration;
    }

    double calculateInterest() {
        return (PrincipalAmt * RateOfInterest * Duration) / 100;
    }
}
```

```java
class RecurringDeposit extends Account {
    int MaturityAmt;
    int Duration;
    int RateOfInterest;
    int MonthlyDeposit;

    RecurringDeposit(String AccountHolder, int PrincipalAmt, int Duration, int RateOfInterest, int MonthlyDeposit) {
        super(AccountHolder, PrincipalAmt);
        this.Duration = Duration;
        this.RateOfInterest = RateOfInterest;
        this.MonthlyDeposit = MonthlyDeposit;
        this.MaturityAmt = MonthlyDeposit * Duration;
    }

    double calculateInterest() {
        return (MaturityAmt * Duration * RateOfInterest) / 1200;
    }
}
```

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FixDeposit cus1 = new FixDeposit("Vishal", 1000, 12, 12);
        System.out.println(cus1.calculateInterest());

        RecurringDeposit cus2 = new RecurringDeposit("Chaman", 1000, 12, 12, 100);
        System.out.println(cus2.calculateInterest());
    }
}
```

## Explanation

### 1. `Account` (Abstract Class)

* Acts as a **base class** for all account types
* Stores common data:

    * Account holder name
    * Principal amount
* Declares an **abstract method** `calculateInterest()`
* Cannot be instantiated directly

This ensures every account type **must provide its own interest calculation logic**.

---

### 2. `FixDeposit` Class

* Inherits from `Account`
* Adds:

    * Rate of interest
    * Duration
* Implements its own version of `calculateInterest()`

**Interest Formula Used:**

```
Interest = (Principal × Rate × Duration) / 100
```

---

### 3. `RecurringDeposit` Class

* Also inherits from `Account`
* Uses monthly deposits to calculate maturity amount
* Overrides `calculateInterest()` with a different formula

**Interest Formula Used:**

```
Interest = (Maturity Amount × Duration × Rate) / 1200
```

---

### 4. `Main` Class

* Creates objects of `FixDeposit` and `RecurringDeposit`
* Calls `calculateInterest()` for each object
* Demonstrates **runtime polymorphism**, as the same method behaves differently for different objects

---

## Output

```
1440.0
144.0
```

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

* Abstract class
* Abstract methods
* Constructor chaining using `super`
* Method overriding
* Runtime polymorphism
* Code reusability through inheritance



## Conclusion

This design closely matches **real-world banking systems**, where different account types share common properties but follow different business rules.
Using an abstract class makes the code **clean, flexible, and easy to extend**, which is why this approach is widely used in real applications.
